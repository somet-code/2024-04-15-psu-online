  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/" target="_blank">supported
    web browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
